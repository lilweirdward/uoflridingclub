            <h2 id="q1">1. What does the Riding & Racing Club do?</h2>
            <div id="p1" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    The Riding & Racing Club is a growing organization on campus and in the community. The Club offers students an 
                    opportunity to connect with people with the same interests. For anyone interested in the equine industry, the 
                    networking opportunities with guest speakers, alumni and even peers, is unprecedented. We offer chances for 
                    students to go to events, facilities and businesses that are not necessarily offered to just anyone. We will be 
                    taking field trips, holding events/fundraisers and providing a number of learning and working opportunities for 
                    our members. We hope to excite, involve and promote our members to the horse industry so they may be knowledgeable 
                    and passionate professionals, participants or fans after graduation.

            <h2 id="q2">2. What kind of field trips does the Riding & Racing Club take?</h2>
            <div id="p2" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                     In the past, we have taken trips to Churchill Downs, the Kentucky Derby Museum, Keeneland Racetrack and Sales, 
                    Stud Farms, the Kentucky Horse Park, Veterinary Clinics, Equine Businesses and Governing Organizations, Rescue & 
                    Rehabilitation Facilities, Horse Shows and so much more! But we love to add different events to our calendar based 
                    off of the interests of our current members

            <h2 id="q3">3. What is an Evaluation Ride?</h2>
            <div id="p3" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    Evaluation Rides are done for the new members of any of our Equestrian Teams. It is basically a lesson taken with one 
                    of our coaches so they can place you in the most suitable competitive division. Remember, there are levels from very 
                    beginner to advanced. Anyone can ride and compete on the team, regardless of their experience.
                </p>

            <h2 id="q4">4. What kind of student joins the Riding & Racing Club?</h2>
            <div id="p4" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    We have students from all different backgrounds. Some ride, some do not. We have a ton of people studying to be all 
                    sorts of things at U of L. You do not have to be an equine major to be involved in the Riding & Racing Club. We have 
                    a lot of super members including riders on the World Cup Team, licensed thoroughbred trainers, NBC Sports broadcasters, 
                    champion riders in multiple disciplines and so much more. Our members are involved on campus, as well!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q5">5. I don’t have a car, how do I coordinate rides to Riding & Racing Club Equestrian Team events?</h2>
            <div id="p5" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    Most of the teams will put out a GoogleDoc spreadsheet in the beginning out that week. You can sign up for a carpool 
                    on that list. Once members have completed their requirements, a contact sheet with the telephone numbers and emails of 
                    all members will be sent out.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q6">6. Do we have to have our own equipment?</h2>
            <div id="p6" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    No, you do not have to have your own equipment to be on one of our Equestrian Teams. Once team rosters have been 
                    established, officers of teams will put together a GoogleDoc spreadsheet with member apparel or equipment and sizes. 
                    Members are more than happy to share, as equipment and clothing can be expensive.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q7">7. Do we have to take lessons to compete on the Equestrian Teams?</h2>
            <div id="p7" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    Yes. In order to be in Good Standing on the Equestrian Teams, you must take the minimum amount of required lessons 
                    per semester. The number of required lessons may vary by Team. If a student has financial troubles, he or she should 
                    speak with the coach or officers of that team. The Riding & Racing Club is more than happy to try to help out members. 
                    Also, some of the coaches have opportunities for students to work off lessons.

            <h2 id="q8">8. What if I need help signing up or filling out paperwork?</h2>
            <div id="p8" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    The officers of the Riding & Racing Club and Equestrian Teams will be hosting a Computer Help Week in the Computer Lab 
                    of the Equine Industry Program Wing. Please feel free to come visit us during the days of September 11 – 17th if you 
                    need help with ANY of the paperwork or forms that need to be completed!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q9">9. Do I need to own a horse to be on the Equestrian Teams?</h2>
            <div id="p9" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    No. The teams are lucky enough to use the horses at the stables at which they ride. At shows, the host school will 
                    provide most of the horses.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q10">10. Can I only join one team?</h2>
            <div id="p10" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    No. You may join as many teams as you like! I would highly encourage you to try each of our three Equestrian Teams 
                    and see what suits you best.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q11">11. Do I need any experience to join the teams?</h2>
            <div id="p11" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    No, there is no experience necessary to be on one of our Equestrian Teams. There are various levels of competition, 
                    starting from very beginning to advanced. There is a place for everyone to take part!
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q12">12. Can I join the club and not the Equestrian Teams?</h2>
            <div id="p12" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    Yes, you may join the Riding & Racing Club without joining one of the Equestrian Teams. There is plenty to be involved 
                    with and attend without joining a team. However, you may not be on an Equestrian Team without joining the Riding & 
                    Racing Club
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="q13">13. I want to invest in my own apparel and equipment, where can I get this?</h2>
            <div id="p13" class="hide-p">
                <p>
                    There are many places around Louisville and Lexington to purchase theses items. You may also want to look online. Please 
                    ask your coach or club/team officers for specific locations. Stores or websites may vary by discipline.
